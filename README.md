a.	
 In visual Studio, to compile a recipe application as follows:
1.	To begin, Open Visual Studio, and choose Create a new project in the Start window.
2.	Select All languages in the Create a new project box, then C# from the dropdown list. Select Windows from the All-platforms menu and Console from the All project types menu. Select the Console App template after applying the language, platform, and project type filters, and then click Next.

•	The software consists of a main method that offers several choices for controlling the recipe application, including adding a recipe, deleting a recipe, showing a list of recipes, showing a recipe's specifics, scaling a recipe, resetting recipe proportions, and wiping all data.
•	If the user selects to press the add a new recipe button, they will be prompted to input the name of the recipe, the quantity of ingredients, and the number of stages for the ingredients. The user will then prompted for details on each ingredient and step before adding them to the recipe. 
•	The number of components will then be entered by the user.
•	The user will then add each ingredient's amount and unit of measurement and the total number of steps. There will also be instructions for the user to follow. The program will display the whole recipe, including the ingredients and processes, in an easy-to-follow style.
•	The user will have the option to have the amounts returned to their original values. To input a new recipe, the user will be able to delete all data.
•	If the user selects to view recipe list, they will be given a list of recipes from which they can select which one they would like to view.
•	The user will be able to filter out the list of recipes by entering the name of an ingredient that must be in a recipe, choosing a food group that must be in the recipe or selecting a maximum number of calories.

c.	Upon receiving feedback from my lecturer, I have made several changes to my application. For part 2 of my assignment, my project was able to display a full list of recipes saved by the user but unfortunately it was not stored in alphabetical order, so I was encouraged by my lecturer to improve on that. Although my program was running and it did everything it was supposed to, it was not very user friendly. For part 3 of my assignment, I therefore had to make an effort to make it easier for the user. I did that by giving the user options the user more options to choose from when selecting a food category because not everybody is aware of the different types of food groups.
